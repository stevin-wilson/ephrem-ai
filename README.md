`ephrem-ai` is a Node.js package that combines the ephrem library with OpenAI’s API to fetch Bible passages based on user-inputted descriptions.
It uses OpenAI models to generate scriptural references and the ephrem library to retrieve the corresponding Bible passages.
This open-source tool is designed to make scripture exploration easier and more intuitive for developers, scholars, and laypersons alike, all for the glory of God.

## Features

- Natural Language Queries: Users can input descriptive queries like “Jesus turns water into wine,” and the package will generate the relevant Bible reference and retrieve the scripture text.
- Multiple Bible Versions: Fetch Bible passages from various translations, such as the KJV, BSB, and more.
- OpenAI Integration: Supports multiple OpenAI models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini) for accurate generation of Bible references.
- Multilingual Support: Ephrem allows fetching Bible passages in multiple languages, supporting both LTR and RTL text directions.

## Prerequisites

1. API.Bible Account: You’ll need an API key from API.Bible.
2. OpenAI Account: You’ll need an API key from OpenAI.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```shell
npm i ephrem-ai
```

## Setup (One-time Configuration)

Before using `ephrem-ai`, you need to configure it to use OpenAI and API.Bible APIs.

### Setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` Environment Variable

Follow the steps below based on your platform to set the environment variable.

#### Windows

1. Open Start and search for “Environment Variables”.
2. Click on Edit the system environment variables.
3. In the System Properties window, click Environment Variables.
4. Under User variables, click New.
5. Set the Variable name to `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the Variable value to your OpenAI API key.
6. Click OK to save.

Alternatively, if you are using PowerShell, you can set it temporarily with:

```shell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
```

#### macOS / Linux

1. Open a Terminal.
2. Use the following command to set the environment variable temporarily (only for the current session):

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

3. To set the environment variable permanently, add the above line to your shell configuration file:

- If using bash, add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.
- If using zsh, add it to your `~/.zshrc`.

### Setting up `ephrem`

Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/stevin-wilson/ephrem?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to set up the `ephrem` library.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can fetch scripture text by describing a biblical event or passage.

Example: Fetch a Passage

```ts
import { seekPassages } from "ephrem-ai";

await seekPassages("Baptism of Jesus", "KJV", {
	contentType: "text",
})
	.then((passages) =>
		passages.forEach((passage) => {
			console.log(`- - ${passage.data.reference} - -`);
			console.log(passage.data.content);
		}),
	)
	.catch((err) => console.error(`Error fetching passage: ${err.message}`));
```

Expected Output

```plaintext
- - Matthew 3:13-17 - -
     [13] ¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.  [14] But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  [15] And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.  [16] And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:  [17] And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

- - Mark 1:9-11 - -
     [9] And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.  [10] And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:  [11] And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

- - Luke 3:21-22 - -
     [21] Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,  [22] And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

- - John 1:32-34 - -
     [32] And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  [33] And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  [34] And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
